# Data Analysis by Levi O. Vasconcelos

This is a sample of my work as a Data Analyst. The goal was to analyse the shoppers' positional data and come up with insights and metrics to help on leveraging the sales and on measuring the effectiveness of items arrengement and promotional sites.

As available data, there is a part of the store's blue print and positional data gathered from their interal system.

The positional data is formatted as tuples (#section, timestamp, stay_time), such as (104,1464752042,6) where informs that a person was detected on section 104, at the time 1464752042, and he/she spent 6 seconds there.

This work was developed and presented using jupyter notebook and pyspark. This repository contains all the data necessary to run the .ipynb file. There is also an .html file available, for easier visualization.

The visualization using the .ipynb is prefered, since I have used interative graphics. But the .html and .pdf versions are good enought to illustrate the whole idea.

#Dependencies
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Pyspark

#Running guide
There is quite a helpfull guide that I've followed to get pyspark working with jupyter notebook:

Basically, you have to declare some environment variables once you have both correctly installed.
